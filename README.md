## Hi, I'm Liang Chen

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by [Prof. Kam-Fai Wong](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/kam-fai-wong/). 

My research focuses on **post-training techniques** for large language models (LLMs), aiming to make LLMs more reliable, robust, and safe. Some recent projects include:

- **BRIDGE** (New Preprint):A cooperative learning framework for training advanced reasoning models.
- **VAA** (ICML 2025): A safety alignment method that identifies and reinforces vulnerable examples to improve safety retention.
- **PEARL** (ICLR 2025): An instruction tuning method for improving LLM robustness in in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **WatME** (ACL 2024): A decoding-time watermarking method that leverages lexical redundancy for lossless embedding.
- **CONNER** (EMNLP 2023): An evaluation framework for assessing LLMs as generative search engines.

I'm currently exploring reinforcement learning (RL) and large reasoning models (LRMs).

Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested in discussing research â€” I'm always open to academic conversations.
