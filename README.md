## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Liang Chen (é™ˆäº®)

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), advised by Prof. Kam-Fai Wong.

My research focuses on **trustworthy large language models (LLMs)**. Recent work includes:

- **VAA** (ICML 2025): A safety alignment method that identifies and upweights vulnerable examples to improve safety retention.
- **PEARL** (ICLR 2025): An instruction tuning method to enhance LLM robustness in ICL and RAG scenarios.
- **WatME** (ACL 2024): A lossless text watermarking approach leveraging lexical redundancy during decoding.
- **LLM evaluation** (EMNLP 2023): An automatic evaluation framework to assess LLMs as generative search engines.

ðŸ§  I'm currently exploring **large reasoning models (LRMs)** and am open to research discussions or collaboration opportunities.
